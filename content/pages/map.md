There are so many restaurants and food stalls in the Dotonbori area so you dont really know where to eat so to make it east we booked an evening [food tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Osaka/Evening-Food-Tour-of-Osaka/d333-31383P13).

### Himeji

Time for some more culture - today we'll head to Himeji and it's famous [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himeji_Castle). This was by far our favorite castle last time we visited so if Wilma & Julia is to visit a castle, this is it!
Once back in Osaka we'll make a visit to [Umeda Sky Building](https://www.skybldg.co.jp/en/) for some views, if we have time we'll also make a stop at [Tenjinbashi Suji](https://insideosaka.com/tenjinbashi-suji-shopping-street/), poor Magnus is going to get so tired of all the shopping!

### Time for some dark history - Heading to Hiroshima

Our next destination is Hiroshima. The plan for the day is to visit the [Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Museum](https://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng), the [Peace Memorial Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial_Park) and the [Genbaku Dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima_Peace_Memorial).

### Miyajima Island

Just outside Hiroshima is [Miyajima Island](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html). Here you'll find the [Itsukushima Shrine](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3450.html) with it's floating torii gate. The island is also home to [Mount Misen](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3451.html), a 500 meter high peak which you can reach by either a long exhausting hike or by riding the Cable Car, guess which one we  will choose!  
To help with all the logistics we secured Ken as our guide for the day via (Get Your Guide)[https://www.getyourguide.com/hiroshima-l32662/hiroshima-private-half-day-miyajima-tour-t387185/].

### Our Final day

Noooo, we have reached the final day in Japan (atleast for this time).<br><br>
We'll leave the agenda open for the day so that we have room for some last minute gift shopping.<br><br>
If we don't need to spend the whole day shopping we can head to the [Yokohama English Garden](https://trip.pref.kanagawa.jp/destination/yokohama-english-garden/1440) for some TikTok opportunities, unfortunately we might be to early for the roses to bloom. 
And, unless we managed to fit it in during the first 3 days in Tokyo, let's make sure we book a treatment at [Rabbicour](https://rabbicour.com/)
<br><br>
We're also staying right next to the Imperial Palace and it's amazing gardens so we can always go out for a stroll.
