Today I woke up and felt a bit nauseous. Instead of the hotel breakfast I opted for some yoghurt from the convinience store while the others enjoyed their crepes.

After breakfast we took a taxi to the station for our 4h train ride to Tokyo. This is where it all went south, as soon as I stepped out of the taxi I started to feel very ill, "hiding" behind a pillar I figured out it was some kind of food poisoning.<br>
Feeling much better I gamled on that I would be able to make it all the way to Tokyo on the train.

I made it to Tokyo without an incident but as soon as we got off the train it was Magnus turn to get sick. Since the hotel was only a 15min walk from the station he opted to walk while the rest of us took a taxi with all the bags.<br>
Me and Magnus decided to stay in for the rest of the day while Wilma and Julia went out for some shopping and food.
