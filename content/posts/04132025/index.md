Time for some art, more specifically digital art at <a href="https://www.teamlab.art/e/borderless-azabudai/">teamLab Borderless</a>.<br>
The moving images and the installations with lights and mirrors are pretty cool to look at but it's easy to get a bit dizzy and lose your balance while watching!

Just outside the exit there was a cool looking cafe,<a href="https://www.sembikiya.co.jp/azabudai-hills/en/">Sembikiya</a>, or maybe it was the pictures of the fruit based Parfaits that drew us in. <br> 
We all picked different versions. I ended up picking the Queen Strawberry Parfait, apparently the Queen strawberry is the most expensive Strawberry in the world and only available in Japan through the 
Sembikiya fruit company and at Harrods in London!<br>
Mmmm, so yummy!

Walking around in the Azabudai Hills Village we came upon an art exhibition, a bit curious we decided to check it out and were pleasantly surprised.<br>
The artist was Tomokazu Matsuyama, a New York based artist said to be one of the world's most notable next-generation artists. It was really really cool!

Next up on the agenda was <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html">Akihabara</a>, the center of electronics, gaming, manga and anime culture.<br>
Once we got there we figured out it was time for some food and we stumbled upon a place serving Japanese Curry!<br>
Filled up we set out in the rain to check out the streets and shope of Akihabara. I also tried my luck on the claw machines and lo and behold, I won a Kirby on my second try!

We finally got around for some some sushi for dinner. We went to <a href="https://www.sushitsune.co.jp/shibuyaparco/">Mawari Sushi</a>. Great sushi about 3min from the hotel!
