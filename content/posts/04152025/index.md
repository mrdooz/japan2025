We started the day strong with Japanese style breakfast before we headed in to Kyoto with our sights set at the <a href="https://www.insidekyoto.com/kiyomizu-dera-temple">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>.<br>
We had a very nice taxi driver that did origami when waiting for customers and at red lights and he presented the girls with a crane each.

Our driver dropped us off at the corner of Gojo-dori and Matsubara-dori, from there it's about 200 meters along Matsubara-dori to reach the temple. We stopped at many of the stores along the way and also managed to find some ice cream.</a>
Once at the temple we visited the tainai meguri, you enter a pitch dark tunnel and is guided towards a holy stone by only a handrail.<br> 
Touching the smooth stone is said to grants wishes and provide blessings.

Next we walked through the temple and the temple grounds before heading down to Kyoto center via <a href="https://livejapan.com/en/in-kansai/in-pref-kyoto/in-gion_kawaramachi_kiyomizu-dera-temple/article-a2000498/">Sannenzaka and Ninenzaka</a>.<br>
On the way down we also found some steamed buns filled with wagu beef stew that made a perfect lunch!

We also stopped by <a href="https://www.insidekyoto.com/nishiki-market-downtown-kyoto">Nishiki Market</a> and made sure that Magnus finally got his sought after beef stick before hopping on the train back to our hotel i Arashiyama.

Dinner was enjoyed at <a href="https://www.buonagio-kyoto.com/">BuonAgio</a>, a teppanyaki restaurant we found last year and really really liked. It was as good as we remembered it.
