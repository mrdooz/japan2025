After finding the hotel and leaving the bags we went around the block to the Okonomi-mura building, guess what's in this building? About 24 Hiroshima style okonomiyaki restaurants! We picked the one with the higest reviews on Google, it was run by 4 old Japanese ladies that din't speak any english. And, the verdict is in, Hiroshima style is superior to the Osaka style.

Having eaten much much more than we needed we took a walk to our next destination, the <a href="(https://hpmmuseum.jp/?lang=eng)">Hiroshima National Peace Museum</a>. It's a quite scary museums but at the same time very educational, lets hope this never happens again.<br><br>
Once through the museum we needed an ice cream to recover a bit before exploring the memorial park and the A bomb dome.

For dinner we found a small local restaurant and enjoyed some oysters, gyoza and Wagu beef.
