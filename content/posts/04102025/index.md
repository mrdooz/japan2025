The trip is officially on!<br><br>
In the morning we took a taxi to the airport and met up with Wilma & Julia. After a quick stop at the hotel we set out for some exploration locally here in Shibuya.<br>
We started with Shibuya Scramble Crossing, and to get a view from above, we made a quick visit to Starbucks. To get access to the windows with a view we had to buy something, and who am I to say no to a coffee!

The exploration of Shibuya continued with capsule machines, some noodles for lunch, a visit to the Nintendo store, alot of walking and a visit to a roof top park.

In the evening we took the subway 2 stops south to Meguru, we managed to hit the rush hour and the subway was absolutely crowded!<br>
Our destination was Meguru River, a famous cherry blossom viewing place!<br>
The Meguru area was way less crowded than Shibuya so it was much easier to find a place to eat. We settled for some Thai food before we headed back to the hotel for some well needed rest!
