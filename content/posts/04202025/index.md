After a quick breakfast we met up with Ken, our guide for the day, at Hiroshima Station.<br> Destination for the day was <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3401.html">Miyajima Island</a>. To get there we travelled by the local train followed by a short ferry that took us out to the island.<br>

Our first planned activity on the island was to ride the cable car up <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3451.html">Mount Misen</a> and take in the absoutely stunning views.<br>
Unfortunatley it was cloudy and rainy so the views were non existing, on the way down we saw a little of the foliage below us.<br>
Atleast we had an ice cream at the top to celebrate!<br>
On the walk back down to town from the cable car station we passed by a Koi pond. Our guide Ken had told us to save the tip of the ice cream cone and feed it to the Koi.

Once back in town we headed for the <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3450.html">Itsukushima Shrine</a>. The shrine itself is built over water and its famous Tori gate looks to be floating in the water. Quite impressive shrine.

There is also a temple on the island, <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3453.html">Daisho-in Temple</a>. Ken gave us a guided tour of the temple and explained some of the rituals, he also asked us to take part in some of them.<br>
The temple grounds is also filled with <a href="https://www.okujapan.com/blog/japanese-jizo-statues/">Jizo statues</a>, small stone statues, made in the image of Jizo Bosatsu, the guardian god of children and travellers.<br>
During the colder months, travellers and locals takes care of the statues by dressing them in homemade bibs and hats, they are usually red since the color red in Japan wards off illness and danger.

We also managed to squeeze in some shopping while walking between the different activites on the small cozy narrow streets. We also found some delicious curry bread on the way back to the ferry.

After some rest back at the hotel it was time to find some dinner. We didn't need to go far, around the corner we found "No gyoza No life", a nice little place with Gyozas as their speciality. Depending on who you ask, the winner was the Hiroshima style gyozas or the Cheeze gyozas.
