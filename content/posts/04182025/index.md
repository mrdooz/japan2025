After breakfast we set out towards Himeji, it's quite a bit west of Osaka so to get there we had to hop on the train once again.<br>
The castle is very impressive and the view when exiting the train station is pretty cool.<br>
And then when you finally reach the castle grounds, it still looks to be almost as far away.

Before hopping back on the train we stopped for some well deserved ice cream, it's pretty good work out to climb the tower and 25 degrees doesn't make it any easier.

Once back in Osaka we it was time for lunch. We ended up at a sushi place, this time it was a real conveyer belt place. Once we figured out how it worked we had some great sushi and we all left pretty happy!

After a well needed nap at the hotel we went out shopping in the <a href="https://insideosaka.com/shinsaibashi-suji-shopping-arcade/">Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Arcade</a>.<br>
After snacks and face masks were properly aquired we stopped for some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okonomiyaki">okonomiyaki (savory pancakes)</a> down in Dotonbori.<br>
And, before heading back to the hotel we made a stop for some more <a href="https://www.gov-online.go.jp/eng/publicity/book/hlj/html/202305/202305_08_en.html#:~:text=Taiyaki%20is%20a%20traditional%20Japanese,a%20sea%20bream%20(tai).">Taiyaki</a>,
