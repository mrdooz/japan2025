Feeling much better we set out for some shopping. Our first target was Don Quijote Ginza, about halfway through Magnus called it quits and went back to the hotel, he took a nice walk through the park and also got some lunch on the way. <br>
The rest of us continued our shopping!

When done in Ginza we went back to the hotel to drop off the heavy shopping bags and had some lunch before embarking on the next shoppng shift!<br> 
A couple of hours later with some more things aquired as well as a new bag for Wilma we got back to the hotel for a short rest before dinner.<br>
You also got to love the japanese signs you can find all over the place.

Our last dinner in Tokyo turned out to be tacos and quesadillas at restaurant and bar Mol√© about a block from the hotel.<br>
Now we all went back to our rooms to try to pack/fit all the things we bought!
