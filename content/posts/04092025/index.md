Not sure if it was the traffic or the driver, but our ride to the airport took almost 4 hours. According to the driver there was an accident on the route just before the airport, but I doubt the fastest re-route would be via Manhattan, so I think he took a wrong turn and ended up in the tunnel to Battery Park....<br>
Luckily, we accounted for random New York traffic and still arrived at the airport in time.

The flight over was quite bumpy but other than that we both got a few hours of sleep and arrived in Tokyo in pretty good shape and managed to venture out and find some dinner, ee somehow managed to end up at the same place we had our fist dinner last year!
