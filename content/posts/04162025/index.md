Today we had booked a guided tour to take us to a few places in and around Kyoto that's a bit hard to fit into one day without a car. It wasn't so much a guided tour (but he did his best), it was more of a private driver for the day sticking to a set itinerary. But, it was very nice to be driven between places and told where to go for once!<br><br>
First stop was <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3908.html">Kinkakuji (the Golden Pavilion)</a>. Pretty cool building in a beautiful setting.<br>
Next up was Nara, 1.5 hour south, here we checked out the T≈çdai-ji temple from outside the fence since the line was way too long. We checked out the bell tower and fed some of the famous bowing deer.<br>
Before leaving Nara we stopped for some fried rice and ramen noodles.

Next we headed back towards Kyoto and the <a href="https://www.insidekyoto.com/fushimi-inari-taisha-shrine">Fushimi-Inari-Taisha Shrine</a>. We took a short walk and captured some photos of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torii">Torii gates</a><br>
And the tour ended with a visit to the small bamboo forest next to our hotel.
