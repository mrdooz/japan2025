Our next destination Kyoto was waiting for us so we checked out of our Tokyo hotel. Since the subway rush hour can extend until 10:00 we took a taxi to Tokyo Station to not upset the locals with our bags.<br>
The train only takes 2 hours 15 min but I think we all managed to fall asleep before reaching Kyoto.<br>
Once in Kyoto we had some issues finding our reserved taxi sine the map the hotel sent us with the pickup point lacked quit a bit of details. After a call to the hotel we finally found out car and were off to the hotel.

Our hotel is a bit outside of Kyoto, in Arashiyama along the river and it's so peaceful and quiet out here compared to Tokyo. We also got rooms with private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen">Onsen baths</a>.<br>
And, since we arrive around lunch time we had lunch at the hotel before taking a short walk in the local area.

For the evening we had booked a <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Kyoto/Kyoto-Night-Foodie-Tour/d332-63670P6">Kyoto food tour</a>, it was the four of us, a british couple and the tour guide.<br>
The tour had 3 stops, the first being a restaurant serving traditional Kyoto food. I think it's safe to say that none of us will order this again but it was fun to try!<br>
Next up was a bar for some sake tasting and fried chicken and to end it off we went for dessert.
