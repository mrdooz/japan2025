We started off with a very chill morning. The train didn't leave until 13:02 so there was plenty of time to relax and for some last minute soaking in the private onsen!<br> 
At noon we checked out and jumped in the taxi to the train station for our ride towards Osaka. We got to the station with plenty of time to spare since maps said it could take between 22min and 1 hour to get to the station, and we wanted to play it safe! To pass the time, Wilma and Julia bought us some ice creame from one of the station's vending machines.<br>
We then hopped on the train and 15 min later we arrived in Osaka!<br>

Once a the hotel only one of the 2 rooms was available early so we opted for lunch in the hotel restaurant, after a week of primarilly Japanese food we all went for differnt kind of burgers!<br>
The second room was promised at 15:00 but since it still wasn't ready we received complementary welcome drinks in the bar but as soon as we received the drink the room was ready! High floor rooms with some great Osaka views!

Once settled we headed out, we walked over to the <a href="https://insideosaka.com/shinsaibashi-suji-shopping-arcade/">Shinsaibashi-suji Shopping Arcade</a>, an extremely long covered shopping street with both high end stores and tourist gift shops.<br>
When the shopping street crosses the river you reach Ebisu Bridge and <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/spot/2207/">Dotonbori</a>with its neon signs and restaurants.

We then stopped for Kushikatsu (tempura skewers) before ending the tour with dessert in the form of <a href="https://www.gov-online.go.jp/eng/publicity/book/hlj/html/202305/202305_08_en.html#:~:text=Taiyaki%20is%20a%20traditional%20Japanese,a%20sea%20bream%20(tai).">Taiyaki</a>, a type of filled panncake in the shape of a sea bream (filled with custardu, yum!!).
