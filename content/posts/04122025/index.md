We got lucky today, we managed to fit in our visit to <a href="https://www.tokyo-skytree.jp/en/">Tokyo Skytree</a> on the day with no rain on the forecast!<br>
The Tokyo Skytree is located in the Sumida city of Tokyo and it took us about 45 min door to door to get there. Being a Saturday the subway was not to crowded and there was no line at all to get up to the top!<br> 
It was still a bit foggy in the distance so we didn't get to see Mt Fuji but we got some great views over Tokyo both from the 350m observation deck and from the 450m observation deck!

After the views we headed towards Sumeda River and the cherry blossoms, a 15 min walk in an area that looks so completely differnt from Shibuya where we are staying. It still amazes me how the different cities can look and feel so completely different!<br>
Once by the river we checked out some cherry blossoms as well as all the girls taking their yearly Sakura photos.<br>
We also got some great views of the Tokyo Skytree from below!

Next up was <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3001.html">Senso-Ji Temple</a><br>
It's a beautiful temple with small wounderful adjacent gardens. Since it's a tourist trap there is also plently of street food vendors so we managed to get some lunch as well.<br>

With some new energy we checked out all the small covered shopping streets in the area, when the feet got tired we stopped at a cafe for some rest before continuing the exploration.<br>
Quite tired we returned to Shibuya but we could hadly make it to the hotel. There was so much people that there was a standstill on the sidewalk! We had to backtrack and cross the street to manage to get back to the hotel. Guess we know where everyone's at on a sunny Saturday!

For dinner we went to Shibuya Teppanyaki Rin, we thought it would be a Teppanyaki experience but we got seated in a separate small room and only the steak was fried so no Teppanyaki for us. It was delicious though.
