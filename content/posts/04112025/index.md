After breakfast we set out towards <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3034_002.html">Yoyogi park</a> & <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3002.html">Meiji Jingu Shrine</a>.<br>
When we reached the temple we found out that on April 11 each year they hold the Empress Shoken Memorial Ceremony. We arrived just when the ceremony had finished and met a caravan of Priests leaving the temple.

After the park we headed for the nearby Harajuku shopping district, on the way we stopped for some donuts at "I am donut ?" since the line was only about 10 minutes long, and not enormous like the last time we passed by (a year ago).

Time for lunch!<br>
For lunch we had booked tickets to <a href="https://samurai-restaurant.tokyo/top/top.php">the Samurai Restaurant</a>, an amazing, over the top show along with bento box or ramen!<br>

With the show over we headed back to Harajuku, this time we headed for <a href="https://tokyocheapo.com/entertainment/harajuku-takeshita-street-guide/">Takeshita Dori</a>, a youth-driven fashion street with colorful sweets and quirky shops. I bet the girls had spent more time here if we weren't in tow!

After another rush hour subway trip, atleast this one was only for 1 stop, we got back to the hotel for a short rest before dinner.<br>
We had some soup dumplings and fried rice for dinner. Exhausted from the long day and the 13 hour time difference the oldies opted for bed!<br> 
Wilma and Julia took the opportunity to spend some quality shopping time on their own at <a href="https://japanportal.donki-global.com/koryaku/en/archives/30.html">Don Quijote</a>
